# 📘 Deep Learning Fundamentals with TensorFlow

This project is a personal learning track designed to build strong foundations in **deep learning** while also covering the **undergraduate-level basics** needed to understand and improve real-world code (such as the fall detection training script from my internship).

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build confidence with **TensorFlow/Keras** for model implementation.  
- Strengthen **mathematical and computer science foundations** relevant to deep learning.  
- Develop the ability to **read, understand, and modify** production-level training code.

## 🗓️ Learning Phases

### Phase 1: Fundamentals
- [ ] Tensors & operations (TensorFlow + linear algebra basics)  
- [ ] Dense layers & activations (dot product connection)  
- [ ] Loss functions (MSE, cross-entropy) & probability review  
- [ ] Optimizers (SGD, Adam) & gradient basics  

### Phase 2: Neural Network Basics
- [ ] Training loop: `compile`, `fit`, `evaluate`  
- [ ] Dataset pipelines with `tf.data` (batching, shuffling)  
- [ ] Build and train a simple MLP on MNIST  
- [ ] Understand metrics: accuracy vs precision/recall  

### Phase 3: Convolutions & Sequences
- [ ] CNNs: Conv1D & Conv2D basics  
- [ ] Regularization: BatchNormalization, Dropout  
- [ ] Residual connections (ResNet idea)  
- [ ] Attention & SE blocks (introduction and simplified versions)  

### Phase 4: Training at Scale
- [ ] Callbacks: EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, TensorBoard  
- [ ] Class imbalance: precision, recall, F1-score  
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning: batch size, learning rate, filters  
- [ ] Compare different training strategies  

### Phase 5: Internship Model
- [ ] Full walkthrough of the **Fall Detection model**  
- [ ] Simplify & modify components (Conv1D branches, SE blocks, attention)  
- [ ] Replace/experiment with training strategies  
- [ ] Document improvements and performance comparison

## 📒 Daily Routine
Each day (~30–35 minutes):  
1. **20 min** – Learn a new concept (coding + foundations).  
2. **5–10 min** – Quick quiz/test to check understanding.  
3. **5 min** – Commit code/notes and update progress in this repo.  

---

## 📝 Notes
- Progress will be logged day by day in `notes/` (e.g., `day1.md`, `day2.md`).  
- Each note will include: key learnings, questions asked, test results, and reflection.  
- Repo structure will grow as more examples and utilities are implemented.
