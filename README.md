# Learning CS Repository

## Purpose

This repository serves as my dedicated learning space for preparing myself to be a well-prepared MSc Business Analytics student. 

## Learning Schedule

ðŸ“… **Daily Commitment**: 30 minutes per day  
ðŸŽ¯ **Target Duration**: Until June 2026  
ðŸš€ **Goal**: Master fundamental Computer Science concepts and algorithms essential for business analytics

## What I'm Learning

This repository contains my practice implementations and exercises covering basic CS fundamentals:

- **Basic Computer Science Concepts** (Programming fundamentals, logic, etc.)
- **Sorting Algorithms** (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, etc.)
- **Search Algorithms** (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- **Data Structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc.)
- **Algorithm Analysis** (Big O notation, Time/Space Complexity)
- **Programming Logic & Problem-Solving Techniques**
- **Basic Mathematical Foundations** for CS

## Learning Progress

ðŸ”„ **Currently Working On**: Basic Computer Science fundamentals and programming concepts  
ðŸ“ˆ **Next Steps**: Advanced algorithms and data structures for analytics

## Why This Matters

Since I haven't taken any Computer Science classes before, building these fundamentals is crucial for:
- Understanding how computers process information
- Learning to think algorithmically and logically
- Data analysis and manipulation techniques
- Optimization problems in business contexts
- Efficient processing of large datasets
- Making data-driven decisions with proper computational foundation
- Technical interviews and academic success in MSc program
